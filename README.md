<h1 align="center">App Customer Churn for a Savings Bank in Peru</h1>
<p align="center">Project Description</p>
This project is based on a prior project with the objective to predict the likelihood of customers of a Savings Bank in Peru churning three months into the future [https://github.com/cpumarfrohberg/customer_churn_dockerized_streamlit_app]. The fitted model has been deployed to streamlit cloud.

## Main content of the project
* 1. data
* 2. `utils.py`and `main.py`for model fit
* 3. artefacts folder containing pickled model
* 4. `app.py`(streamlit app)

## For running the model on streamlit
- go to streamlit cloud [https://cpumarfrohberg-customer-churn-streamlit-app-app-vpa0zb.streamlit.app/]
- insert information on Loan Officers in order to get predictions

## Future Updates
- [ ] train a model based on predictive features for churn of **Loan Officers** (instead of clients themselves)
- [ ] deploy on `fastAPI`
